## Description

This project is part of the coursework for CSC500. It consists of two parts:

**Part 1:**
Write a Python program to find the addition and subtraction of two numbers.
The program asks the user to input two numbers (num1 and num2), then adds and subtracts them to display the results.

**Part 2:**
Write a Python program to find the multiplication and division of two numbers.
The program asks the user to input two numbers (num1 and num2), then multiplies and divides them (num1/num2) to display the results.
